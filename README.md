## eCommerce Project
Welcome to the ongoing eCommerce project built with Node.js, MongoDB, and Express using clean architecture. This project is designed to help developers learn about the structure and implementation of clean architecture in a real-world eCommerce application.

### Introduction
The goal of this project is to build a scalable and maintainable ecommerce platform using Node.js, MongoDB and Express with Clean Architecture. The project is divided into different modules such as Category, Product, User and Order. Each module has its own use cases, entities, repositories and controllers.

### Architecture
Clean Architecture is used for this project. Clean Architecture is a software design pattern that emphasizes the separation of concerns and the use of layers to ensure that the code is maintainable, testable and scalable. Clean Architecture consists of four layers:

- Entities: These are the domain models or business objects that encapsulate the business rules and logic.
- Use Cases: These are the application-specific business rules that define the use cases of the application.
- Repository: These are the gateways or interfaces that define the methods to interact with the data sources.
- Controllers: These are the interfaces that handle the HTTP requests and responses.
